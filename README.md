These simple matlab functions show you how to convert from surface-to-surface ambient seismcic field Green's function to predict shaking from realistic earthquakes. One example is provided for a local earthquake in southern California (with earthquake data and ambient noise cross correlation) is stored here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/0z27g37zxpco1tl/example.tar.gz?dl=0). Relevant publications provided in the docs. 
This version is limited to point sources, extention to larger earthquakes will come later.
