Virtual Earthquake Approach

These simple matlab functions show you how to convert from surface-to-surface ambient seismcic field Green's function to predict shaking from realistic earthquakes. One example is provided for a local earthquake in southern California (with earthquake data and ambient noise cross correlation). Relevant publications provided in the docs. 
This version is limited to point sources, extention to larger earthquakes will come later.
